# INTRODUCTION
## Motivation
This is a personal project to understand more deeply how neural networks work and maybe later test with edge cases like self modifying networks. As of today 29/04/2022 I've achieved to make a model to predict the types of flowers in the [Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) as you can see in the following [graph](https://github.com/glpcc/Neural_network_experiments/blob/master/img/Iris%20Data%20prediction.png).
## Installation and usage 
To install all dependecies run the following command
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then you can run for testing the main.py and main2.py and you will see a graph ploting the accuracy and the error through the epochs. You can also tweek with the parameters like the amount of layers or neurons, the learning rate, etc...
