## Motivation
This is a personal project to understand more deeply how neural networks work and maybe later test with edge cases like self modifying networks. As of today 29/04/2022 I've achieved to make a model to predict the types of flowers in the [Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) as you can see in the following graph.
